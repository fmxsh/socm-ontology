## Not the best

If we are to meaningfully understand the general pattern of all conceptual models, that understanding also need be perceived as a conceptual model. But the perceiver has an interest in what things to perceive, for he or she is interested primarily in useful things to the perceivers self-interest. Thus, for a conceptual model to occur to the perceiver, it must be perceived as meaningful. The perceiver is thus part of the model being perceived, in that the perceivers self-interest invests in the model as useful. Models around meaninglessness can not be built, because meaningless things would not be of interest to the perceiver to perceptually differentiate and analyzed and concluded as conceptual models, simply because there is no believed use for them. All and any conceptual model must have the perceiver as part of it, meaning the perceivers preferences sustains the model. The perceiver and the process of perceptual differentiation are crucial to any conceptual model. _Structure of conceptual models_ must be a _conceptual model_ itself, because there can not be any structure outside _conceptual model_ because it is such a fundamental concept that for anything to exist outside it, it would exist outside perception, and that is not possible. Because _conceptual model_ resides at the origin of all meaning, it must be part of anything, even its own description. _Conceptual model_ is the perceptual basis, even for a model made to understand its own general structure.

All meaningful perception is mediated by conceptual models. For something to be perceived as a meaningful structure, it must be meaningfully and uniquely differentiated. This differentiation, the process by which understanding is formed, is conceptual modeling. Therefore, even the general structure of conceptual models must itself be made meaningful to the perceiver by becoming a conceptual model. However, for anything to be meaningful, it must be associated with the perceivers perception, and only then will perceptual differentiation and analyzis preform the conceptual modelling to create the conceptual model.

The perceiver is not external to the perceived and somehow outside of it, observing and defining the _conceptual model_. Instead, the perceiver of a _conceptual model_ is part of the very thing being perceived, and influences how the thing is structured to appear to the perceiver. This sounds counterintuitive. After all, I am watching the computer screen outside myself as I type this. That is true. My body is clearly separated from the screen. Let us clarify that any mere sensory perception is never, the focal point of this ontology. It does not try to describe the pressumed _real_ that ought to describe _things as they are in absolute relaity_. This ontology does not concern itself with such an absolute reality independent or not of the perceiver. It would rather look at absolute claims with suspicion, suspecting a conceptual model is mistaken for being an absolute truth, and that the statement of absolute truth rather reflects absolute ignorance. Still, there selfevidently to the perceiver are absolute truths in the sens that they absolutely applie: falling off a cliff has an undeniable consequence, and is not a matter of choice of conceptual model. This ontology, while not dealing with absolute truths, deal with _absolutely relevant truths_. These are truths that are relevant to the perceiver. At the very core of _absolutely relevant truths_ is the truth that _a certain thing of perception is favoured over another_. This truth is evident, because the human makes a choice reflecting that value.

A human being, no matter its beliefs, will make certain choices favouring something over something else. A choice has to be made, and choice reflects values. No human would jump off a cliff deadly as naturally as it comes to seek food. A human who does self-harm, for example refuses to eat, does so, also reflecting a certain value in opposition to the value of the opposite choice. The perciever simply can not perceive anything without favouring one thing over another. A person who claims to meditate and get into _pure perception_ without judgment, would simply, to start with, initiate that based in a choice to do so. It would be one choice among all other possible choices reflecting other values. Technically, a person in a serious medical condition, who perhaps does only perceive without any activation of the executive function of the frontal cortex, likely is not in an functional state of being, and would be consumed by a wild animal in the forest. Such a person isn't consumed by wild animals, because he or she relies on the help of others and is protected in a hospital. However, the point is that nature itself, the _absolutely relevant truth_, would terminate such a person, and so, nature encourages choice and values of that which leads to self-preservance. Every human being, in capacity of perception, knows innately to prioritize favourable things. Culture may articulate religious ideas, or the stupidity of youth (such as in "you only live once" and "live fast, die young") in attempts to transcend the _absolute relevant reality_, but the same people still evidently act to keep their own vitality to some degree, and in doing so, confirming the truth of these _absolutely relevant truths_. They do something right, they live on collected resources and vitality, or they by benefiting from others who knowingly or not protect them from reality that simply neither resonate with their ideas nor care about them, as consequences in old age overshadows the once so youthfull consciousness with bitterness and regret,... for what? for bad choices, all in acordance with the _absolute relevant reality_. It could be argued modern civilication, born of the intelligence of mankind, protects us from wild animals, and thus we can discard what is here claimed as _absolutely relevant truths_, to be nothing but _largely irrelevant concerns_. But...

Contemporary modern society only makes the same _absolutely relevant truths_ more subtle. Old age, sickness, misfortune and so on, are still self-evident in the experience of humans, and well confirms the _absolutely relevant truth_ that certain choices have better outcome, and thus certain thing in perception are favoured over others, thus reflecting certain values over others. Choice, value, the progression of sequential time -- these are all _absolutely relevant truths_. Furthermore, even if society protects itself against nature, old age, and sickness, there still is the dimension of human social interaction also demanding choice for the same reason of preservance, as for example, political enemies may seek to cause detriment to eachother. The _absolutely relevant truth_ is on of binary: either or, good, bad, favourable or not, etc. The human being, merely by existing, is forced to the core beneath all layers of nuance, to the _absolute relevant truth_ which is the binary truth of that certain things are favored over others, and if not, related consequences follow. Remaining at the gray zone also is not possible, as time itself progresses, and tilts the surface for the individual to slip, more often than not, to the side of misery and detriment. In this ontology, what is true, is not a matter of what is thought of the world by elaborated theories, but from the simple self-evident reality of what one enacts. This ontology takes its fundamental strength from the fact humans enacts the _absolutely relevant truth_ as stated here.

Having outlined that this ontology rests on the self-evident truth that human beings enact choice prefering one thing over another, and we actually have to do so, we can now with precission clarify that any speculations or claimed absolute truths about reality as independet from our own perception, are irrelevant. The objective reality of the 31-inch screen I am looking at right now is not of interest. Instead, what matters, is the idea I have of how the screen is useful to me. I as a human being evaluates the usefulness of the screen, and construct an idea of how to relate to it for my benefit (or for whatever I value). I deterimine the usefulness of the object, and this reflects the _absolute relevant truth_, stating that I enact choice, preferring what I believe is better. Rather than concerining myself with the "objective reality" of the screen, I construct a _conceptual model_ of what the screen is, and this _conceptual model_ is influenced by what I, the perceiver, find valuable. If I am a computer programmer, I place the screen as my focal point as, perhaps, crucial, but if I am Neo-Luddite -- someone opposing modern technology in favour of a return to nature -- I will have a _conceptual model_ of the screen as being a piece of glorified junk. Of course, one may choose what is detremental, but this is still a choice, and still reflects that one thing is selected over another, and the reason behind the choice reflects a value, and that value is prefered by the actor, for whatever reason. While an adult can be confused about values, and believe that all values are equal and a matter of choice, this is against the self-evident nature of things. If such was the case, a child would not innately prefer constructive actions by default such as seeking and consuming food. Confusion of basic truth happens as a skewing of the value system, for among other reasons, cultural reasons. Culture may believe differently, but it is also self-evident that violent contact sports, with hits against the head, is a detriment to the cells of the brain. It is self-evident with scientific knowledge, but also without it, because nature enacts the consequence of causing mental disability. The self-evidence consists of that nature responds accordingly, and this is part of the _absolute relevant truth_ which enforces better choice over worse. Clear is that values are not, at its fundamental level, a matter of personal choice. While humans may demand freedom to be respected for personal choice, nature doesn't offer that, and has no sympathy for those who suffer the consequences, whereas they, perhaps, in contempt of the nature of things, seek sympathy from others. It was stated earlier that while most of us in modern society do not have to fear wild animals, the thret agains a human's wellbeeing is still just as real, even if more subtle, which necessiates choice of what is better over what is worse. The modern term "burn out" reflects this, with the meaning that a person is overworked, having caused high cortisol levels for prolonged times, and having been in repeated and prolonged states of fight-or-flight, causes damages to the internal being. Such missery is a consequence which very much confirms the _absolute relevant truth_ that detremental consequences are real and thatthe human being has an invested interest, by, to the best of ones ability, making certain choices over others, to avoid such detremental consequences.

Having now clarified that there are consequences, choice, values and preference, and that there is no state of being free from these, we can now clarify the most fundamental aspect of perception, which this ontology is based in. We naturally favour one thing over another, and thus, there must be at least two things in a moment of perception. Because there are two things, there must be difference. If there is difference, each of the parts must be unique and different from each other. If perception can be of such a kind that it can perceive difference and uniqueness, then definition and boundaries can be known. The uniqueness being perceived is hereby termed _unit_. It is important to point out an _unit_ refers to anything occuring to perception, where a thought therefore also is an _unit_, just as much as a physichal chair is. However, when we perceive the chair, we layer ontop of that perception or conceptual understanding of what it is. Without conceptual understanding, the chair is meaningless and likely will not be noticed. It is difficult to imagine how a chair could not be noticed, but that is only because our conceptual understanding of chairs is so deeply rooted that we recognize them instantly. Someone scanning a crowd for a person in a red shirt will see it right away, while someone not looking for it may not notice it at all, because it holds no immediate meaning. The same applies to sound: certain birdsongs carry meaning for someone with the conceptual understanding to interpret them, while to others they are just background noise. Another example is a police officer or interrogator trained to notice subtle behavioral cues. Where an untrained observer might see only a relaxed person, the officer may recognize signs of concealment, deception, or intoxication. Their conceptual model informs their perception, shaping what they see, what they interpret, and what meaning emerges from the encounter. At a fundamental level, there is no difference in perception between imaginations, thoughts, sight, sound etc. All of these rely on the perceivers capability of _perceptually differentiation_.

This ontology then recognizes _perceptual difference_ itself to be part of any object that is perceived. It is what _constrains_ the object to have a particular form. Without perceptual defferentiation, there can not be awareness of where the object starts and ends. Any kind of object must inherently be differentiated from everything else to be perceived meaningfully. The perceptual differentiation is seen as integral to the object. If the objects boundaries are there _in objective reality_ is not a matter of interest. What matters is that the perceiver perceives those boundaries. One person may perceive a set of speakers to include the cables, whereas another may say that "speakers" refers only to the speaker units. Each perceiver draws the boundaries differently, and obviously they deal with a _conceptual model_, not with the here pressumed objective reality.

A _conceptual model_ is an idea that occur in the mind of the perceiver. The _conceptual model_ has internal descernable _units_ making upp the model. The many _units_ of the inside of the _conceptual model_ are structured in accordance with the _structure of conceptual models_ which is a analytical, fundamental structure. It defines the fundamental categories of any _conceptual model_ and it analyzes the inside of a _conceptual model_ to correctly identify and categorize the _units_ according to the structure stipulated by that _structure of conceptual models_.

So... to define and understand a given _conceptual model_ we apply _structure of conceptual models_. However, that one is itself a _conceptual model_. If we want to understand _structure of conceputal models_, which itself is a _conceptual model_, we need to apply itself in describing itself. The text you are reading now is the _structure of conceptual models_ treating itself as a _conceptual model_ being subject to the analysis of _structure of conceptual models_.

These are brief definitions. Their exact definitions are understood by following how each term emerges in and trough the _the universal categories_.

## Other

Reading: The _structure of things_ can be applied in analyzing anything to describe it with exhausting perceptual clarity. Thus, the analytical process of applying _structure of things_ is applied to describe itself. This very scentence is read right now by a perceiver, who is applying the _structure of things_ to discern what a _structure of things_ is. Right now, as this is being read word by word, the analyzis is enacted by the structural category of _identity_, right now, being isolated and brought to perception as a part of the _thing_ which in this case is _structure of things_. The _structure of things_ contains in itself the means to construct itself, in relation to a perceiver. There is nothing outside _structure of things_ that describes and justifies it.

A _structure of things_ is a potential perceptual structure any things. That is; the _thing_ does not exist as such to the perceiver, unless the perceptual differentiation process of the perceiver, is capable of differentiating the thing and its content by this structure. Thus, _structure of a thing_ is enacted, putting analysis in action, causing exhaustive perceptual clarity to be realized.

A _structure of a thing_ is a _thing_ (becomes a recursive structure with _constitution_ in regard; see _constitution_). It is not a thing in a sense of being a separate thing beside other things. It is a _thing_ in the sense that it is any _thing_, wherever a _thing_ is present.

We thus do not have _structure of things_ that acts on a _thing_ to for example describe it, like _logos_ acts on humans, to describe them. Instead, the _structure of things_ is intrinsic: it is the way any thing is. The _structure of things_ thus is self-evident by the very being of the thing. The thing itself, by existing, and thus necessarily having the structure of _structure of things_, thus is self-evident as a _thing_ with _structure of things_ intrinsic. Thus, _structure of things_ is not conceptual framing that is applied to analyze a thing. It is the organizing principle of the thing, necessarily arising from its beingness. A thing, being its own complete description, merely by being in its perceived uniqueness, is thus self-analyzing. Any thing applies its own analytical fundamental structure, to itself, even if that reality remains indirect as a mere potential for the perceiver to realize by applying the analytical fundamental structure of _structure of things_. The thing is self-structuring in the sense it is a thing that the perceiver then can analyze to perceive the very structure. The structure of _structure of things_ is true, because it can be verified. If _structure of things_ would be ontologically irrational, it would not be able to be verified in a thing.

For any thing x, if x exists, then x necessarily conforms to the structure of things; and the truth of this structure is verifiable through the perception of x.

Because all things intrinsically have the self-evident structure of _structure of a thing_, any _thing_ described, necessarily can be analyzed by _structure of a thing_, because it has the foundational structure of _structure of a thing_. It is thus always possible to analyze a thing by applying _structure of a thing_, even the _structure of things_ itself, as is being done here. The _structure of things_ is a analytical fundamental structure, used to analyze things, and as such, it is its own thing, and thus can itself be analyzed by the same structure of analysis that it is.

(The _structure of things_ postulates a set of properties: identity, constitution, constraint, emergence.)
