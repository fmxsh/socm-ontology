# Ontology of thing of things

Identity: The _Ontology of thing of things_ an ontology in that it describes a _thing of things_. A _thing of things_ is a root meta-structure: that is self-defining, self-constituting, self-organizing, and self-reflecting.

- It defines defines the general structure of any specific structure, including itself.
- It is constituting any structure, including itself.
- It organizes any structure, including itself.
- It describes any structure, including itself, using descriptive categories that are structures defined by _it_, and that are _it_ in essence.

The ontology describing it, which describes the _thing of things_, is in itself, a _thing of things_.

Purpose: To define the _thing of things_.

Identity: The _thing of things_ is a

Constitution:

- Perception of difference.
- Value-driven favoring of one thing over another.
- Purposeful, ...
- The _thing of things_ consists of _thing of things_. It is thus self-constituting.

Property: The _thing of things_ is self-constituting, because it constitutes itself.

Emergence:

The ontology of _thing of things_ is a root meta-ontology.

- It is _root_ because it defines the general structure which is the structure of any specific structure.
- it is _meta_ because it is self-defining, self-constituting, self-organizing, and self-reflecting.

Self-defining: It names and identifies its own role and composition.

Self-constituting: Its purpose (root intent) determines what differences matter — thus, it creates the parts it needs to fulfill that intent.

Self-organizing: Through structured perception and categorization.

Self-reflecting: It describes itself using the same descriptive categories that define other things.

## Start

### A thing is

There is perception of this sentence right now. In this sense, this sentence is real. When remembering the sentence, the sentence is no longer real as something that occured to perception, but the very memory of it is real. Just like the sentence was real when it was percieved, the very memory of it that now occurs, is real as it is percieved right now. There is a present moment, in the sense there is a current perception right now. Any memory of the past and thought of the future must be a thing that is real only as a memory or thought in the very moment of perception. The thing the memory or thought refer to, is not real, because that which it refers to, is not present to perception, but only the reference to it is, meaning the memory itself is real, but not what it refers to.

Memories and thoughts occur in a space of concepts. Concepts are real as they occur to perception. A concept is also unreal, in the sense it is not the very thing it refers to. The occurence of the concept in perception--the thinking of the thought-- is not the occurence of the thing the concept refers to--the thought is not the thing being thought of.

A concept is a reference to something that existed, exists or may exist in the sense of occuring to perception. A concept always refers to something real. The concept of "water flowing upstreams" refers to both "water" and "flowing" which in turn are concepts that relate to the occurence of these realities to perception at some point. The unrealistic concept "water flowing upstreams" is a concept refering to a future occurence of such a phenomenon.

Concepts can be realistic or unrealistic. Things that occur to perception appear in patterns and with continuity. These patterns and continium reflects a rule by which things in perception organize themselves. A concept can refer to a past, present, or future thing in a way that is not supported by rule of things. Thus, while the concept correctly does refer to something, that very thing will not occur to perception.

This is true at a fundamental level, because the color blue can not be the color red at the same time in perception, or it would break the ability to percieve a thing, as thins can not be distinquished. There may be an alternative universe in which the unrealistic is realistic, but the goal of this theory of ontology is to support ontology that focuses on effectivity as measured by how well the ontology organizes things and relations among things to support the ontology's stated purpose.

There is only preception of the current moment. That I existed yesterday is an assumption based on a memory and an assumption based on observatoins of that physichal bodies appear consistently over time, and that "I" am associated with a specific such body. There is a stage of waking up from deep sleep, where I sometimes do not recall my waking identity, I do not know where I am, I do not know what time it is. In the absence of memories, I do not know if, how and where I existed yesterday.

### Things are

There is the field of perception.

Things exist in the field of perception.

Cognition arises from change in the field of perception.

Cognition arises in relation the percieved.

## The newest here:

## More things...

Do not wrongfully make categories into things. A category holding 3 sub-cats should not lead to the assumption the three sub-cats create an emergent thing that would be the parent cat. Perhaps, as a rule, do not have overarching categories. Whats the purpose, other than wrongfully used convention for the sake of it, rather than as with structural relevance as reason.
The document should only consist of things, not categories that are not things.. Each heading represents a thing. What about sub,headings? Should then Conceptual definition and semantic attribution be _things_... as that is my way of categorizing... yes, they can be made into ontological things, ... I guess..

For identity, describe by order of conceptual casual chain...

## A thing, format

Identity: A thing's identity is what the thing is not. Identity is a constitution of the rest or is there any reason for this category.

Each concept is a thing created by defining what it is, but without reference to a more abstract or concrete layer. An example of a reference to a more abstract layer is if _a[1,2]_ + _b[1,2]_ = _c[11,12,21,22]_, then we have 4 different _c_, and it would be tempting to group them under a general category _x_, which would then look like a general thing that can be any of the four, but there is no _general thing_, there are just these four _c_. Example: A _field_ has _data format_ and _data type_ and combined they create a set of _data constructs_. We could wrongfully assume those _data constructs_ are _fields_, but there _is_ no thing called _field_, only our own grouping of the four _data constructs_ which are _things_.

It also does not refer to representational layer; that which is semantically attributed to. That would be to refer to the more concrete level.

Identity starts with "X is..."

The _thing_ IS, by all its parts and properties, the culminating emergence. Without the category "identity", there is just emergence as structure, but no definitive clarification that that is what the thing _is_. "Identity" clearly states what of its constitution makes its total identity. Identity thus is the totality of the structure constituting the thing.

Properties:

If it is a description of structure within, it is a property.

Constitution:

If it is a thing, it can be a constitution of another thing.

we can say, when we rely on external conceptual units like _tokens_, its constitution, but when internal, its property. so _data format_ and _data type_ is property, because its a characteristic we see within the structure made by the constituting things. properties are thus not things. but defines a thing. Any _thing_ that is part of a thing is constitution

A property is not a thing, but something seen in the structure of a thing. A constituting element is itself a thing, and thus is part of the structure of the composed thing."

Emergence:
We treat emergence not as an extra feature of a thing, but as the thing itself.

## Constitution

Constituents:

## Property

Property 1:
Name: Example: data format.
Inference: Inferred/explicit property.
Recognition:
Modes: Example: X can be either true or false
Interface labels:
Props automatically give labels, for example:
[data construct: data format (inline | block)]

Property 2:
Name: Example: data type.
...
[data construct: data type (identifier | literal)]

## Emergence

Name:
Type Structural, behavioral, or functional emergence
Recognition:

### Property

Identity: A property is a _thing_ that is a concept, existing in the space if thought, describing the characteristic of a _thing_.
Constitution: Space of thought, a _pre-fundamental thing_ which encapsulates things.
Property:
Emergence: Characteristic.

### The ontological chain:

Emergence depends on property, and property depends on constitution.
Constitution alone does not produce emergence — it must be interpreted to yield properties.
Properties are recognized internal structures among the constitutional things, and these recognized structures are the emergent thing that the thing _is_.

Constitution ➝ Property ➝ Emergence

Layer What it is Relation to the others
Constitution The composed-of layer — the structural components that are themselves things. Provides the basis for...
Property The patterned or characteristic layer — structural features seen in the assembled parts. Emerges from constitution, but is not reducible to it.
Emergence The new thing that comes into being from the configuration of properties. Arises only when the properties align in a way that creates new structural identity.

## Defining the building block of the ontology

A _thing of thins_ is:
Self-defining: It names and identifies its own role and composition.

Self-constituting: Its purpose (root intent) determines what differences matter — thus, it creates the parts it needs to fulfill that intent.

Self-organizing: Through structured perception and categorization.

Self-reflecting: It describes itself using the same descriptive categories that define other things.

### Defining the _thing_ of a thing.

Purpose: What does a _thing of things_ do? organize the field of perception in acordance with choice based in usefulness. (a thing can thus self-constituting, as the root purpose of all things, is to organize the field of perception (meaning define constitutions, properties etc) in accordance with choice based in usefulness. Usefulness is the root purpose, and a thing defines its specific purpose based in that core purpose)

Identity: A _thing of things_ is a discernable purposeful entity that contains discernable enteties that are purposeful to the thing.
Constitution:

- Constituted by the perception of difference.
- Purpose, that one discerned thing is favored (choosen) over another.
- Value of good and bad basis of choice and purpose. An usefull thing is good, a harmful thing is bad.

A _thing of things_ is also constituted by the structure of purpose, identity, constitution, property, and emergence. Thus, a _thing of a thing_ is self-constituting (consisting of the things it defines), self-organizing (organizes itself by the way it defines), and self-reflecting (describes itself using the categories it created). (In addition to this, it is self-defining, in that it identifies its own role in the purpose part, and the purpose part is a result of its self-constituting ability to create such a thing called "purpose")
i

... any constitution of a thing, is the perception of difference, steered by purpose, thus steered perception creates the things needed to fulfil the purpose of the thing.

... The thing envelops many parts and self-constitutes it by enveloping them.”

Property: A thing has the property of containing units. An unit is percieved because of the difference between it and other units. Things are percieved on basis of purpose and usefulness.

Emergence: One unit, delinated in the field of perception, emerges, which has many units. The unit is purposeful.

(The thing of things: It is constituted by perception of difference and the value-driven favoring of one thing over another. It has properties, such as the ability to contain subunits and be perceived as a unit. It gives emergence to structures — these emergent things are the solid, nameable "units" of your system (like data construct). That emergent unit becomes the first usable "Thing" in your ontology.)

A thing of things is a discernible purposeful entity containing other, to the thing of things, discernible purposeful entities.

### Defining the description of a thing:

Identity: The description of a thing is the description, as outlined in text, of the thing's. The descriptoin follows a structure of identity, constitution, property, and emergence.
Constitution: Identity, constitution, property, and emergence.
Property:

- Sequence: The order of the categories is as follows: identity, constitution, property, and emergence.

Emergence: Combining the constitutions of identity, constitution, and property, the emergence in sequence, is the description of the thing.

### Defining identity, constitution, property, and emergence

(Each their own heading, each their own thing)

#### Identity

Identity: Is a concept...
Constitution: Consists of a _thing of things_.

Property:

- Self reliant (: Each concept is a thing created by defining what it is, but without reference to a more abstract or concrete layer.) And all the rest...
  Emergence:

Emergence: a _thing of things_ takes the form of _identity_ by the combined properties...

## Some old stuff here:

### Ontological Truth of a System

#### Goal

The purpose of this ontology is to define the fundamental nature of an effective system by identifying its ontological truth—what it is at the most basic level. The ontology establishes that things are the fundamental concept, as all systems are composed of things and their relationships, and that, while systems may be percieved without having been intended by a particular conscious agent, an effective system, more precicely, _is_ caused by a conscious agent. The effectiveness of the system is dependent on the ontological truth established by the agent.

#### Concepts

Things:
(Things that exist independently and can be uniquely identified.)

> [!Note]
> This ontology uses itself to describe itself, thus, in the category of things, we have the concept of "things" itself.

- Things: The most fundamental objects in this ontology—anything that can be identified, distinguished, or considered as existing.
  - Exist if they can be distinguished from what they are not.
  - A thing has unique properties or an unique combination of properties making the thing distinguishable and separate from another thing.
  - Things are immutable, in that it can not change and still be the same thing.

> [!Note]
> Now, "things" is a thing in this ontology. Here, it is a thing, that describes what things are.

- Agents: Conscious observers that recognize things and impose structure by creating systems.
  - Can observe, distinguish and identify things.
  - Can intend to impose structure on things by establishing an ontological truth.
  - Can organizing things and their relationships in accordance with the ontological truth.

Emergent structures:

- Relationship:
  - A thing can relate to one or more things and can be related to by one or more things. (A door in a wall relates to the wall and the floor, the inside and outside).
- Structure:
  - A structure is an identifiable totality, a set, consisting of things and their relationships. A set of football players can be arranged in a particular strategic formation, distinct from another formation.
  - A structure has properties of its own. For example: the formation of the football players has a property of being a defensive formation.
  - A structure may or may not exist regardless an agent's awareness of it. The things and the relationships among them that gives rise to a structure, must be specified, for the structure to be recognized as a structure. The agent specifies them in the ontological truth of the system.
  - A structure is an emergent entity that depends on the things and their relationships, but is in itself independent of any agent’s intent and goal. A structure may exist as intended and recognized by one agent, but may also exist in another place, not intended by the same agent, or not intended at all by any agent.
- System:

  - A system emerges when an agent organizes things into a structure. A system is different from a structure, in that it is a structure that alignings with the agent’s intent as stated by the ontological truth.

- Ontological truth:

  - The agent, by observing and identifying things, and by intending to impose a system, specifies an ontological truth of a goal, what the things relevant to the goal are (the ensures the existence of the relevant things and describes them), the relationships between them, their emergent enteties.

  (enteties that do not exist independently, but as a result of things and their relationships, [...] and

- Effectiveness:
  - How well a system's entities, properties, and relationships produce an observable, measurable effect that aligns with the agent’s intent.
  - Effectiveness itself is objective (it can be observed and measured), but it cannot be asserted without defining the system’s goal.

#### Relationships

Dependencies:

- Things exist independently.
- Systems depend on things; no system can exist without things.
- The ontological truth of a system depends on the intent of the agent creating it.

Rules:

- A system's ontological truth is determined by the most fundamental description of its things and their relationships.
- If a system aligns with its intended purpose, it can be measured and refined.
- The effectiveness of a system is determined by how well it adheres to its ontological truth.
- External interference or unintended changes can alter the system, but they do not change its ontological truth—only its effectiveness.

#### Context

Constraints:

- Things must be distinguishable to be considered as existing.
- A system must be intentionally created by an agent to have an ontological truth.
- If no agent observes or defines a system, it cannot be formally described, but things still exist independently.

Assumptions:

- The existence of things is a priori; it does not require justification beyond distinction.
- Conscious agents are necessary to recognize and define systems.
- The effectiveness of a system can be evaluated through observation and measurement.

External Factors:

- The environment in which things exist may affect their relationships and interactions.
- External changes to a system may impact its function but do not alter its fundamental ontological truth.

#### Representation

Storage:

- The ontology can be represented as structured text, logic statements, or a formal graph of entities and relationships.
- It can be modeled mathematically, expressed as first principles in logic, or described philosophically.
- It can also be used to define other ontologies, forming the foundation for classifying systems.

#### Meta-Classification

Self-Reference:

- This ontology is categorized under meta-ontologies, as it serves as a foundational framework for defining any system.
- It classifies itself as the ontology of ontologies, providing first principles from which any system can be described.
- This ontology can define itself using its own principles by treating itself as a system composed of things, such as concepts, rules, relationships, and constraints.

## Ontological Truth of a System

### First Principle: Things as the Fundamental Concept

Every system must have an ontological truth, which is the fundamental description of what the system is. However, before we can define a system, we must define things, because it is among things that we can discern whether a system exists.

### Defining "Things"

A thing is anything that can be identified, distinguished, or considered as existing. Things are the most fundamental concept, because without them, no relationships, properties, or systems can be perceived.

- A thing exists if it can be distinguished from what it is not.
- A thing is fundamental because it is a necessary precursor to any structure or organization.
- A thing does not require a system to exist, but a system requires things to exist.

### From Things to Systems

1. Things exist.
2. If multiple things exist, they may interact or relate.
3. When interactions or relationships between things are observed, we can define a system.
4. The ontological truth of a system is the fundamental description of these things and their relations.

### The Role of Conscious Agents

A conscious agent observes things and can form an intent to create a system. This intent gives rise to the system's ontological truth—the most fundamental description of the system based on what the agent perceives and aims to structure.

1. The agent observes things.
2. The agent intends to organize things into a system.
3. The agent creates a system by establishing relationships, properties, and constraints among things.
4. The ontological truth of the system is the formal description of the created structure.

### The System and Its Effectiveness

Once created, the system functions according to its ontological truth. The effectiveness of the system is determined by how well it complies with the agent's intent.

- If a system aligns with its intended purpose, its effect is distinguishable from unintended modifications or external interference.
- The system's effects can be perceived and measured, allowing the agent to evaluate and refine its structure.
- The distinction between the system's designed effect and the consequences of modifying the system allows for an ongoing refinement of its ontological truth.

Thus, a system is the result of a conscious agent's intent to organize things, and its ontological truth serves as the foundational description that determines its effectiveness.

## Also old stuff:

Difference exist. The color blue and red are different.

Thing exist. A thing is what it is not. The color blue is not red, not tall, not loud, not magnetic. When we remove all things we know blue is not, then we see that what remains is the quality of blue. Thus, the color blue is blue.
A thing is not non-existing, because a non-existing thing is different from the thing. Blue is not blue, if blue does not exist.
Nothingness does not exist, because nothingness implies the non-existence of a thing. So nothingness would have to be a thing for it to not exist. And a thing implies existence.
Thingness does not exist as a contrast to nothingness. Thingness exist in contrast to other thingness.
Thingness in contrast to nothingness would mean nothingness is a thing that thingness is in contrast to, like blue is to red, but nothing is nota thing in any way.

Exist if they can be distinguished from what they are not.

Things:
Concept.
Emergence.

A concept is a percieveable set of one or more distinct qualities. E.g. a football player.

A concept can relate to another concept. E.g. One football player on the same field as another football player.
A relation is a concept. It has distinct quality. The quality of a relation is that two or more thins are percieved at the same time. The distinct quality of the relation is for example: the football players are a pair.
A relation is an emergent quality of concepts.
The emergent relation can be a thing, that is is defined as team, that means the parts in the relation share a common goal.
