Change: note i made it constitute of itself, i moved differentiated perception to be a property , i included the perceiver as constitution of the thing... the thing consists of this _structure of things_ structure and the perceiver. The perceiver has self interest, coloring the perception of the thing , steering towards optimal definition of itself. The perceiver wouldnt seek to perceive things not useful to itself, and, remember, a thing exists when perceived, and thus the perceiver steer things into existence by its self interest.

Note: It proves itself also in the perceiver who is able to live by it. Thus, a very strong case of applying it. The application structures understanding leading to furthering of choices in direction of self-sustainance.

Functional Ontological Minimalism,

a post-metaphysical ontology that grounds structure in function and perception, not abstraction.

# Structure of things

## Identity

(Should describe _structure of a thing_, not _thing_, or _thing_ would be described from the outsid), implying a fixed structure. NO, it is fine the _structure of a thing_ deals with a _thing_. Things deal with things.)

A _structure of things_ is an analytical fundamental structure.

- It is _fundamental_ in the sense it is the structure of any thing (including itself).
- It is a _structure_ in the sense it, for a _thing_, postulates four structural categories and the specific meaning of the relations between the content of each structural category. their specific relatoins with eachother, , identifies and categorizes the parts of the _thing_ in the categories identity, constitution, property and emergence.
- It is _analytical_ in the sense that relations among the content of the structural categories constitution, constraint, and emergence are isolated, by differentiating perception, into those categories, and how their relations, that form the unique identity of the _thing_, are explicitly stated.

Being an analytical fundamental structure, that is part of any thing, it brings exhaustive perceptual clarity to any thing.

Thus, a _structure of things_ organizes the perception of any thing for exhaustive perceptual clarity (including itself, thus).

(some inconsistencies in can be applied vs is intrinsically applied)

Reading: The _structure of things_ can be applied in analyzing anything to describe it with exhausting perceptual clarity. Thus, the analytical process of applying _structure of things_ is applied to describe itself. This very scentence is read right now by a perceiver, who is applying the _structure of things_ to discern what a _structure of things_ is. Right now, as this is being read word by word, the analyzis is enacted by the structural category of _identity_, right now, being isolated and brought to perception as a part of the _thing_ which in this case is _structure of things_. The _structure of things_ contains in itself the means to construct itself, in relation to a perceiver. There is nothing outside _structure of things_ that describes and justifies it.

A _structure of things_ is a potential perceptual structure any things. That is; the _thing_ does not exist as such to the perceiver, unless the perceptual differentiation process of the perceiver, is capable of differentiating the thing and its content by this structure. Thus, _structure of a thing_ is enacted, putting analysis in action, causing exhaustive perceptual clarity to be realized.

A _structure of a thing_ is a _thing_ (becomes a recursive structure with _constitution_ in regard; see _constitution_). It is not a thing in a sense of being a separate thing beside other things. It is a _thing_ in the sense that it is any _thing_, wherever a _thing_ is present.

We thus do not have _structure of things_ that acts on a _thing_ to for example describe it, like _logos_ acts on humans, to describe them. Instead, the _structure of things_ is intrinsic: it is the way any thing is. The _structure of things_ thus is self-evident by the very being of the thing. The thing itself, by existing, and thus necessarily having the structure of _structure of things_, thus is self-evident as a _thing_ with _structure of things_ intrinsic. Thus, _structure of things_ is not conceptual framing that is applied to analyze a thing. It is the organizing principle of the thing, necessarily arising from its beingness. A thing, being its own complete description, merely by being in its perceived uniqueness, is thus self-analyzing. Any thing applies its own analytical fundamental structure, to itself, even if that reality remains indirect as a mere potential for the perceiver to realize by applying the analytical fundamental structure of _structure of things_. The thing is self-structuring in the sense it is a thing that the perceiver then can analyze to perceive the very structure. The structure of _structure of things_ is true, because it can be verified. If _structure of things_ would be ontologically irrational, it would not be able to be verified in a thing.

For any thing x, if x exists, then x necessarily conforms to the structure of things; and the truth of this structure is verifiable through the perception of x.

Because all things intrinsically have the self-evident structure of _structure of a thing_, any _thing_ described, necessarily can be analyzed by _structure of a thing_, because it has the foundational structure of _structure of a thing_. It is thus always possible to analyze a thing by applying _structure of a thing_, even the _structure of things_ itself, as is being done here. The _structure of things_ is a analytical fundamental structure, used to analyze things, and as such, it is its own thing, and thus can itself be analyzed by the same structure of analysis that it is.

(The _structure of things_ postulates a set of properties: identity, constitution, constraint, emergence.)

## Constitution

### Thing

A _structure of things_ consists of a _thing_.

- It can only be reflected in a thing. The _structure of things_ is not a trancendental entity, that, if somehow all other things were to vanish, it would remain as "pure substance", "prior to any thing", "from which all things are made". A _structure of things_, contrary to that, is, wherever there is a thing. All things can be analyzed by _structure of things_. A _structure of things_ is not in addition to a _thing_, like logos describing humans. It is not a substrata (for example "pure consciousness"). A _structure of things_ is _the thingness of any thing_.

### Perceiver

A _structure of things_ consists of a perceiver (which in itself is also a _structure of things_).

- A perciever is part of the _structure of things_, because without the perceiver, there is no perception of the thing. The meaningful existence of a thing is dependent on the perceiver. Because there is a perceiver, there is a differentiation of perception enacted by the perceiver.

A perceiver is anything that can describe itself in terms of the _structure of things_. (Directly conscious entity is self-aware, an indirectly concious entity is an entity that can describe itself and is acting as an extension of self-aware enteties (an organizatoin, an AI, and similar)

Because a perceiver describes itslef in terms of the _structure of things_, it also implies a process of choice and purpose. The choices defining the conscious entity (for example a human choosing the values of "athletic") affects the perception of other things, like a bicycle, such that either the things are useful or not to the self-interest of the being perceiving them. A central thing defining a self-conscious entity is self-preservance. Tools to secure self-preservance are favoured over non-functional things.

### Does not consist of

A _structure of things_, or any thing, **does not** consists of a _structure of things_. Even if it has the same categories identified by it (identity, constitution etc...). It is because the categories emerges as self-evident from the process of differentiating perception which all objects are constituted of. Any object thus have all it need to self-organize these categories, and this self-organizing is exactly what _structure of things_ describe. Thus, _structure of things_ does not stipulate a set of categories, it merely show how these, and exactly these, inveitabely emerges in any object.

## Constraint

### Perception

A _things_ is differentiated perception. By the ability to differentiate, we can isolate one thing, recognize it as unique and different from other things.

### Identity

A thing is constrained by its identity. Identity is an emergence, that becomes a constraint.

At the core, we have the recognition of difference in perception. How perception is differentiated (meaning where we percieve the boundaries of a thing) is defined by its identity. One may be surprised many more expensive speakers do not come with cables or even amplifiers. That is because in the domain of high end speakers another ontology presides, where the concept of a speaker is limited to the actual speaker unit, whereas in the budget market, a speaker is understood as "that which makes sound" which then implies a whole set of common things such as sound cables and power adapters. A thing here, thus is understood and delineated by an describable idea. If you ask the dealer in a high end shop about the cables, he would _describe_ the _idea_ that the speaker unit is _just the speakers and not the sound cables_. In a _structure of things_, the identity is the highest delimiting factor, which is also contained within the thing, and thus the thing contains its own boundaries. (It is thus self-delimiting).

The _structure of things_ contains its own boundary as a reflection of its identity. Embeded in the thing itself, is the identity which is the highest structural contraint, or structural affirmation.

It is the act of differentiating perception to isolate the thing by its _identity_ and locate the defining parts (constitution, constraint and emergence) of its identity within itself, (rather than putting the identity outside the thing), that makes the identity self-emerge.

It contains the conditions for its own organization.

## Emergence

A thing must be differentiable. A thing can only exist if it is differentiated from others (from this follows that _structure of things_ is a differentiable, and if so, it implies a unique content, and it implies a boundary by which it can be separated from what it is not, thus implying an inside, and implying identity, and identity in turn implies differentiated perception of its inside, to be able to perceive its uniqueness, which must be there, if the thing is able to be separated from other things. The uniqueness of a thing can be analyzed and knonw, because there is differentiated perception. Differentiation is the fundamental constraining factor.)

The act of putting constraints on the constitution of a thing, is the act of structuring (?) perception of the constitution of the _thing_, which naturally yields emergent structures and behaviours, which inherently becomes part of the thing.

The inside of the _thing_ can be analyzed to have constitutents, and contraints, naturally, because it muust have content that differentiates it from other things. The category constitution and constraint thus are emergent categories of a things identity (that it has an unique _inside_) and the perceivers process of differentiation to perceive the constitution and constraints of the inside.

Thus, of the constraint of differentiated perception, the emergent categories of _constitution_ and _constraint_ are derived. The category _emergence_ is derived as a consequence of the analysis of _constitution_ and _constraint_, and all in its totality constitutes the category _identity_.

### Self-aserting

(Perhaps the most impoprant emergent feature of a thing): All parts are aligned to support the identity. This is implicit, as the identity is integral, and a identity can not be integral to a thing that does not honor it. The boundary of a thing (how a thing is differentiated from other things) is in its totality defined by identity. Things that do not align with the identity, are simply outside the thing, not part of the thing. Remember, a thing is self-evident. It does not need a description on a paper, like a blueprint. It itself is its own description. A thing is self-evident, in that its existence tells what it is (and it can not be wrong or incomplete about it). Any analysis of a thing, thus is evidently correct if it aligns with the self-evident _thing_. It will be evident if a part of a thing relates to the identity or not. In describing a thing, we can do conceptual errors of putting non-identityful aspects in the description, but that is just a bad description, and will simply not have any relation to any thing in reality, other than the bad description itself being a _thing_ that is a bad description.

#### Sum

For any thing to be perceived, there needs to be perception of difference. Based in percieving difference, we recognize a thing, any thing, has properties, , identity, etc. Thus, several dimensions of a thing are outlined. This differentiation among aspects of a thing is possible, because the fundamental constraint of any object, is differentiation. By differentiating things of perception, a set of aspects, or dimensions, or properties, of a thing can be perceived.

The relations between these the categories constitution and constraint of the thing, gives rise to certain emergent features of the thing, which comes to further define the _thing_ and comprise its category of identity.

To call specific things into perception, they must be differentiated for their unique attributes, and the _structure of things_ serves as a way to structure perception of any thing to frame the perception of its specific content with exhausting perceptual clarity, which is achieved by structuring perception to frame its specific content in all its parts in all dimensions, not just a few. The degree of a specific hammer's usefullness is better understood if the totality of what makes the hammer is understood. Therein is for example the identity of the hammer, by which we recognize it. Reviewing the constitution, constraint and emergent features also reveals more of its identity and thus its degree of usefulness. The thing is also containing the perceiver as a constraining factor, meaning the emergence of the specific identity of the _thing_, is shaped by the perceivers values. Sure, a hammer exists _as it is_ regardless of the perceivers values, but it exist only as meaningful, or useful in other words, to the perceiver, depening on the values of the perceiver. The evidence of this is that the following is not perceived as a thing of value to most people: `1f 8b 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 03`, but with the analytical fundamental structure, the thing will be perceived. For example: Identity: A header of a compression file format specifying its identity as `Gzip`, with with associated metadata such as compression method, used to correctly parse the compressed data. Constitutes: Sequential series of binary data. Constraint: the header must come first. Emergence: the rest of the data can be parsed.

In the same way, the thing is recognized to be related to other distinct things, which are perceived by the same capability of perception of difference, is able to discern the things being part of the constitution of the thing. The constitution is also seen as integral to the thing. One could argue the parts of a speaker are not integral to it (they are different external things, just put in the same speaker box, and they all have their own blueprints and can even be sold separately). However, the boundary of a thing (how we differentiate it from other things) is determined here by the integral identity of a thing. All things needed for the identity are considered integral to the thing. The thing specifies all of its parts in _constitutoin_ and a thing is thus self-constituting.

We recognize the constitution, constraint and emergence align with the identity of the thing, whatever the thing. The alignment of constitution and properties, with identity, gives the emergence of the thing being self-defining, because it defines its own identity. By its self-definition, it determines what constitution is needed, and thus is self-constituting.

Just as integral to the thing as identity is, is also the structure that fulfills the identity, and thus the thing is self-fulfilling.

### Structural properties

By the constraint of differentiated perception, several structural categories arises. These amounts to the analysis of the identity of the _thing_. _Identity_ itself also being an emergent structural category.

#### Identity

Identity is the expression of a _thing_ in its completeness. The _thing_ itself, is an expression of itself in completeness. In the _structure of things_, the _thing_ is analyzed by the way of the analytical fundamental structure, which is the _structure of things_. By the mentioned analysis, the identity of an object can be described as a conclusion of its constitution, constraints, and emergence, such that a perceiver has enough structur to perception to be able to recognize the thing itself as occuring in perception. This is very easy to prove. The perceiver of this text will have enough structured perception to perceive the _thingness_ of the following (which was an example explained earlier): `1f 8b 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 03`. The perceiver can only perceive this as meaningful if the _thingness_ of it has first been analyzed and known in some way. If analyzed by applying _structure of things_, the perceiver will have exhausting perceptual clarity in perceiving it. A poor analysis will yield a perception of it as thing such as "it's probably a header of some sort" and such understanding is arrived at by analyzing it against a set of prior experiences, fragments of knowledge and inference. What thing is perceived in this case, meaning, what thing comes into meaningful existence for the perceiver, depends on the perceivers values directing attention to either analyze this thing to know it, or to not do it. The knowing of things, and the degree of clarity, comes to determine the course of a perceivers experiences, where the perceiver naturally has interest in certain experiences. Knowing of certain things is required for certain jobs. Knowing of edible plants is crucial in a certain survival situation.

The analysis _is not_ the _thing_, but describes the _thing_ such that its _isness_ can be recognized.

What the thing is in its self-contained totality. The sum total of its categories; constitution, constraint, and emergence.

It also does not refer to representational layer; that which is semantically attributed to. That would be to refer to the more concrete level.

Without the category "identity", there is just emergence as structure, but no definitive clarification that that is what the thing _is_. _Identity_ clearly states what of its constitution makes its total identity. Identity thus is the totality of the structure constituting the thing.

Example: _Traffic light_ will be our example. We define the _thing_ that people refer to when they say I just got lucky with the _trafic light_ still being yellow while passing. The _thing_ being refered to here, obviously is not only the trafic light box.

Identity of _trafic light_: A trafic light is a device that stops trafic in accordance with trafic situation and law. It consists of a box displaying three lights, green, yellow, red. It is placed in a crossroad, towards the traffic it intends to control. It is connected to a trafic light network.

One may ask why take _trafic light_ in everyday speech. It serves as a good example to show the everyday speach relates to a _thing_, and how the perception of this thing is structured by the perceiver, who, regardless any strict definition, perceives the thing _trafic light_ to be more than the strict definition. Then, by the analysis of _structure of things_ we form exhausting perceptual clarity, and thereby become aware of not only the trafic light box, but also its placement and the trafic light network. The perceptual clarity is useful, and here is a continuation of the example to show that: "I noticed it switched in a slightly different way today, compared to my previous experiences. That is likely because emergency veichles were driving by, but I havn't heard any, thus there is a probability there is civile cops around here, having switched the lights at nearby crossroads. All of this was able to be acheived because of exhausting perceptual clarity, achieved by analysing the everyday speach of _trafic light_.

As stated by this ontology, that things come into existence when known by analysis, by the way, is further very clear in case of civilian police, serving as great example. Effort is made to prevent the _thing_ called civilian police car, from being perceptually differentiated by analysis as to establish its identity as an unit of state authority. Only those who can correctly discern its constitution and constraints can hope to succeed. For example, in old times, it was known all civilian police cars had certain patterns in the numbering of the licence plates. When designing the "civile police car", the designer in question may not have had perceptual clarity enough to consider the default number plate creation a constraint of the thing _civil police car_, and thus had no awareness of how the plates would end up being printed in a pattern as a consequence of the default settings in the ordering process.

#### Constitution

Perception of difference allows for unique things to be percieved. Before any structure is seen in any thing, these are just things that are different from each other. Because we need useful things, we recognize uniqueness among things and ascribe different meaning to different things. We deem things meaningful, meaning the thing aligns in such a way it produces outcome deemed useful. _Constitution_ are the things that a thing must consist of for it to be able to align with its identity.

The color green is not red. We know there is a difference, but still, at this stage, there is no meaning ascribed to the things themselves. We have not yet linked them fully with a identity, just recognized that there are different things, and that we have selected some things to be listed listed under _constitution_ that later in _emergence_ will show to be meaningful to the identity.

Example: A trafic light has green, yellow, red. It constitutes of a box displaying these lights. _Trafic light_ (in our particular use of the word) also consists of a trafic light network.

#### Constraint

Like rules governing the constitution. Example: Constitution: green and red. Constraint: can not be a combination of the two colors.

Can constrain both constitution and emergence, thus full power in shaping the identity.

Continuing the trafic light example: Constraints are now put on the constituting colors:

The trafic light must be separated from a disco light (especially when some disco props are made to imitate the look of traffic lights). Thus, placement is a constraint of _trafic light_, if by the _thing_ trafic light, we mean a device that actually stops trafic (not merely provide light).

- There can only be 3 colors.
- Only one color can be lit at a time, except for yellow, which can be lit with red.
- Must be placed in a crossroad, towards the trafic it intends to control.
- Each light must be a certain luminosity.
- Must be connected with a network that can control the lights. (this constraint is put here, becasue we, later in _identity_ define "trafic light" as a thing that stops trafic in accordance with trafic situation and law)

#### Emergence

(There can be many emergences...)

(The typical meaning of emergence)... The constitution and constraints, and relations among them, form emergent patterns and behaviours.

The trafic light example:

- Connected to the trafic light network, and placed correctly, the trafic light unit will light up the appropriate color and display it in the direction of the trafic to be controlled.

### X properties

#### Self-evident

A thing is the description of itself. The description of a thing is not external to itself. A blueprint would be a thing (it is a blueprint) that describes another thing. However, both the blueprint and the building it describes are two separate things, both having their own _thingness_. The _thingness_ is the complete description of the object. Because all things have _thingness_, all objects are their own description. They are self-evident. They do not need anything to describe them because their very composition is the highest level description of what they are. Just like a person may only understand half of a text description, a person may also only understand half of a _thing_ while observing the thing.

It follows that _structure of things_ itself, that which this text is describing, does not need these words. It exists in its completeness regardless. It is a claim that what this text describes, in fact does exist. This description could as well be false in the sense that it does not refer to anything real. An example of a false description: "Purple consists of the electromagnetic waves. Constraint: wavelength of 1000 nanometers" (it actually has wavelength of ~380 to 450 nm). In a sense, we never perceive the thing firsthand, but always by a layer of understanding, a cognitive model of the thing, that refers to presumed things in the world. We act not in direct relation to the thing itself, but first in relation to the cognitive model of the thing, and indirectly, trough such a model, do we relate to the thing. Our cognitive model is what informs our actions, and we correct or cognitive model by questioning the cognitive model if the result of our actions are not the expected as could be inferred from our cognitive model. Why do we interact indirectly with the _real_ in this way? Because direct perception of the _real_ would necessiate perception of its totality. Total perception would not filter things for usefulness, and thus would leave us vunerable to dangers such as falling off a cliff. Cognition creates perception itself is finetuned to perceive _things_ are useful to us, and to perceive them in increasingly more useful ways. Steep cliff thus is a thing where gravity, distance, direction, surface terrain all are fragments of the pressumed _real_, used to conceptually model the thing _steep cliff_, which we then relate toand successfully prevent a certain sequence of felt consequences. Here, it is also seen that the perceiver is involved in shaping the concept of the thing _steep cliff_. No, the perceiver doesn't shape the _real_ by his conceptual model, as the steep cliff remains regardless the thought of it. The perceiver shapes the very concept of it by including certain fragments of the _real_ such as gravity, distance etc. A value system underlies the selection process for how the concept is constructed, which is based in the perceivers interest. Thus, the conceptual model of the world, by which the perceiver interprets the _real_ is created in conjuction with the perceiver's self-interest. The created concept becomes the _thing_ to the perceiver. The _real_ simply is not directly meaningful to the perceiver. Only the concept is directly meaningful, because it is a shaped interpretation of the _real_, useful and necessary to the perceiver. The preceiver does not really know there is any _real_, but assumes so, because there is a predictability of the consequences of choices based on conceptual models. The perceiver assumes there is a _real_ that is vast, complete, and present, because conceptual models consistently creates predictable outcom when acted in relation to. This ontology does not care to claim there is or is not a _real_. It claim that the perceiver can not know it, but knows only conceptual models of its own making, and knows the felt effects of basing choice on them. Simultaneously, the preceiver is in direct contact with the _real_, but not as understanding it, but by _feeling_ it. The feeling is the direct experience, and the understanding of it is the concept the perceiver constructs based in what is felt. _Feel_ does not refer to emotions, but to anything that impresses the senses (sensing). The reason the perceiver constructs an understanding of what is felt, is because if, instead, feeling instantly goes to action, the perceiver would be deceived and would severely increase the probability of being terminated. A child may be able to sense Santa Clause is real, because he is standing right there at Christmas. The child has more sensing than conceptual modelling and thus acts on appearance.

A note on the child's realization of the deception of Santa Clause: The parents introduces deception into the comfort zone of the child, where, to the child, things are exactly as they appear. Sensation can be trusted to reflect reality as it is. When the deception of Santa Clause is realized, the child has to divorce itself from sensation as reliable source, and start understand things, like _Santa Clause_, as conceptual models being more complex than the mere felt appearances. Felt appearances of the _real_ now become constitutents of a conceptual model (within the _structure of things_), which the now older child primarily relates to, and thus, and the emergent conceptual identity of _Santa Clause_ as "roleplay" now takes precedence, whereas the child relates to the appearance, not by astonishment, but by perhaps scorn, like ("I know who you are"). The beneficial action of not relating to _Santa Clause_ as real is a result, not of relating to mere appearance of the _real_ but by primarily relating to the conceptual model. _Santa Clause_ is _self-evident_ as a deception, because the presence of _Santa Clause_ contains all that is needed to fully understand it. The _thing_ itself is self-evident, and doesn't need our description, but the perceiver needs the description (a good conceptual model) to recognize the self-evident nature of the _thing_.

There is no such thing as "perceiving reality as it is", and especially not by removing conceptual models and only attend to sensation. There are good and bad conceptual models, but there is no reality beneath all models that can meaningfully be concieved of in absense of concepts. Focusing only on sensation, however, can increase the awareness of the feedback from the assumed _real_. This feedback comes to inform the construction of conceptual models.

The perceiver sources the _real_ for fragments to build conceptual models lending predictable favourable outcome when related to as basis for choice and action.

That means: all things can be seen to represent the structure described here, regardless if this structure is described here or not.

#### Structured perception determines a things existence

A thing exists when it is percieved. If not percieved, we can not know it exists. An object in the other room does not exist, but the sense it does is based on an assumption, perhaps because we were in the room 1 minute earlier. A thing comes into existence and goes out of existence, as it comes and goes out of perception. We can not percieve that it does exist, while we do not percieve it. (There is only things as perceived).

This refers to the felt appearance of the _real_ of the thing. We know there is a felt appearance, when we perceive it. We do not know if that felt appearance is still there, if we do not somehow feel it (percieve it).

#### Self-creating/defining

A thing, as a particular thing, is perceived based on perception being structured to percieve it. Perception being structured differently, yields a different thing being percieved. The thing is to the perceiver as it is perceived, but its basis in the _real_ is what it self-evidently is. The perceiver may not construct an understanding of the _thing_ that correctly relates to the _real_. An "inacurate" perception would be its own _thing_ (its own understanding). Those are things, conceptual models, in that they come to be influential as exactly those things to person perceiving them. Based on perception, the thing is determined useful to a degree, and the person will make choice, attempting the better outcome as determined by the persons idea of what is desirable.

A thing comes into perception of the perceiver as to the degree it is useful, and comes into perception in an useful way (preferably). Therefore, not all things matter. This ontology is not concerned with for example a distant star you do not perceive, because if that would matter, then every posibility in eternity would matter. A distant star could matter to an astronomer, because he or she can perceive it and deems it useful to study).

### Thing properties

Note: _Structure of Things_ does not make metaphysical claims about reality-as-such. It describes how things are formed in differentiated perception, and how these structures emerge in relation to the perceiver. Then, a thing is always perceived differentiated, discerned. A non-differentiated, non-discerned thing can not be perceived. The _constraint_ is that all things are based in differentiated perception. Perception includes both sensations and concepts. Sensation is directly knonw, or one would not have an incentive to remove the hand from a hot stove. Conceptual models are also directly known, as such, meaning it is the conceptual model that is directly known, as it impresses cognition, but what the concept refers to, is not directly known, only indirectly trough the concept. A cellphone is a conceptual model and the item it refers to is not directly known. However, the weight of the cellphone can be directly sensed and thus directly known. Material is directly known, but what that material means to us, is only a conceptual model that refers to a thing which we deem have the identity and meaning of the conceptual model. Gravity is not known as "gravity". The concept "gravity" is not directly known. However, the pull of the earth can be felt and directly known regardless of our language, thoughts and concepts.

Because of differentiated perception being the constraint of any thing:

- A thing is what it is not.
  - The color blue is not red, not tall, not loud, not magnetic. When we remove all things we know blue is not, then we see that what remains is the quality of blue. Thus, the color blue is blue.
- A thing is not non-existing, because a non-existing thing is different from the thing. Blue can not be blue, if blue does not exist.
- A thing is immutable, in that it can not change and still be the same thing.
- A thing is a particular thing, it is not another thing.
- A things existence is contingent on perception. If a thing is not perceived, it is not a thing. If a thing is perceived, it is a thing.
- A thing must have an identity.
