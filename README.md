# Thing of things

## Identity

A _thing of things_ is a _thing of things_, that is a fundamental framework. (intended self-reference).

- It is fundamental in the sense it is the foundational structure that can be applied to any thing.
- it is a framework in the sense it defines the outermost boundaries of any defined thing, within which the specific variatoins and patterns of the specific thing are defined.

Thus, a _thing of things_ organizes the perception of any thing for exhaustive perceptual clarity (thus, including itself).

The _thing of things_ is not a trancendental entity, that, if somehow all other things were to vanish, it would remain as "pure substance", "prior to any thing", "from which all things are made". A _thing of things_, contrary to that, is, wherever there is a thing. All things can be analyzed by _thing of things_.

A _thing of things_ is not in addition to a _thing_. It is not a substrata.

A _thing of things_ is _the thingness of any thing_.

Reading: A _thing of things_ (as defined here) is a _thing of things_ (which provides the construct to define itself), that is a fundamental framework.

## Constitution

The _thing of things_ is constituted by differentiated perception.

A thing is what it is not. Differentiated perception gives rise to the recognition that there are different things.

By the ability to differentiate, we can isolate one thing, recognize it as unique and different from other things. (This constitutional ability or mechanism is used to recognize that the thing we construct is a thing).

Contrast.

## Properties

Some overall thoughts before starting with individual properties:

There can not be any thing without the thingness of the _thing of things_.

(These are the properties of any thing, and thus also of the _thing of things_, as seen in that the _thing of things_ itself describes itself using these properties, thus is self-referential, self-organizing)

Articulated _thingness_ and inarticulated _thingness_.

A phenomenon may exist and affect a person, but to the person, does not exist, and its effects may be perceived, but aren't known in the sense of knowing the thing causing the effect. Corporate policy exists and affects the employee in may ways; effects that may be perceived, but still the employee does not know the thing causing the perceived effects (for example, a young employee may even not know companies have policies for different things). The employee may have a wrongful idea of the thing caused it, and may be wrong about it. The thing, even if wrongful, is then real, and exists, to the employee, but then as kind of meta thing: a thing that is real in the sense of being a real wrongful thing, that then has the real effect of misleading, while the employee believes that the wrongful perception is real at face value. An outside observerer may conclude the wrongful idea as being a typical misconception, and thus to that person, "typical misconception" is a _thing_ with certain constitution, properties, emergence and identity.

The articulation of _thingness_ forces analysis at the most fundamental level, leading to exhausting perceptual clarity, in case the analysis is correctly identifying constitution, property, emergence and the conclusive identity.

In articulated _thingness_ is the things having effect, but that have not been articulated, and thus not known to the person.

A thing may or may not exist prior to being articulated. Weather it does or not, is not of interest. The person knows a thing exists, when it has been articulated, and that matters, because that knowledge gives effect on how attention is oriented "in matter". Thus, it is knowledge that "matters". A person who knows certain behaviours are company policy, for example, focuses attention on aligning the matter of the body and speech in movement and sound in relation to policy.

Inarticulated _thingness_ is a retrospective title, which, because of retrospective application, also indicates prospective transformation from inarticulated to articulated _thingness_. This means that because we now know a _thing_, because we have articulated it, we can in retrospect say that it, prior to its articulation, was inarticulated _thingness_. With the validity of terming something of the past as inarticulated _thingness_, based on the fact we have seen it transform into articulated _thingness_, we can also say that there likely are inarticulated _thingness_ right now, that can become articulated in the future, and thus are prospective.

Inarticulated _thingness_ is a category that hinge on the reality of an articulated _thing_. We can say there are inarticulated _things_ that should be articulated, because it increases situational awareness (however, things must be evaluated for their realness, by measuring real world effects). If I claim there is an intergalactic war, I need to demonstrate it in perceived reality or it is real only as a mental thing. Percieved reality is not merely perceived reality at face value (because the mind can distort things), but is what consistently responds in accordance with reality.

### Organizing principle

A _thing of things_ must have an internalized identity (it must have its identity defined within itself, as a cause of its internal parts).

All things in _thing of things_ must be consistent with an organizing principle (the identity).

The organizing principle (the identity) defines the boundaries, in such a way that whatever is not consistent with the identity, is outside the boundary of the thing, and thus is not part of the thing.

Internal coherence/consistency is established by how each part enacts and supports the identity.

### Structural properties

All things are

#### Identity

Describes what the _thing_ is, in terms defined by itself (the content of its constitution, properties and emergences).

A thing also identify as a _thing of things_ by being an application of _thing of things_, in the sense that the properties constitution, properties and emergence are used to analyze and describe the _thing_.

It starts with "I am a _thing of things_ that is ..."

It does not state purpose. Purpose can be implied, and is subjective.

Identity is the emergence of all the properties and constitution of a thing.

What the thing is in its self-contained totality. The structure emerging from the constitution, properties and emergences of the thing.

A thing's identity is what the thing is not. Identity is a constitution of the rest or is there any reason for this category.

Each concept is a thing created by defining what it is, but without reference to a more abstract or concrete layer. An example of a reference to a more abstract layer is if _a[1,2]_ + _b[1,2]_ = _c[11,12,21,22]_, then we have 4 different _c_, and it would be tempting to group them under a general category _x_, which would then look like a general thing that can be any of the four, but there is no _general thing_, there are just these four _c_. Example: A _field_ has _data format_ and _data type_ and combined they create a set of _data constructs_. We could wrongfully assume those _data constructs_ are _fields_, but there _is_ no thing called _field_, only our own grouping of the four _data constructs_ which are _things_.

It also does not refer to representational layer; that which is semantically attributed to. That would be to refer to the more concrete level.

Identity starts with "X is..."

The _thing_ IS, by all its parts and properties, the culminating emergence. Without the category "identity", there is just emergence as structure, but no definitive clarification that that is what the thing _is_. "Identity" clearly states what of its constitution makes its total identity. Identity thus is the totality of the structure constituting the thing.

**What about purpose?**

Not needed. Anything provided by purpose can be included in other ways. Say an ax made of a wooden stick and flint stone i made by ancient civilication x. The purpose would typically state "Central tool for many things in ancient civilication x". That can instead be written as a property: "Designed and shaped using tools available in Ancient Civilization X" and "Also operates as a cultural artifact and symbolic object within its society", and in this way it comes into identity like "An axe composed of a wooden shaft and flint head, crafted by Ancient Civilization X", because identity is based in the constitution, properties and emergence of the thing.

Purpose is redundant, thus...

Purpose category is removed... We said a _thing_ is constructed with regard to its purpose, and everything is justified by its resonance with the purpose. However, removing purpose means identity becomes like that...

Identity: The _thing_ is so and so. Then all other parts of the thing has to be oriented to the identity, and measured against the identity for how well the parts resonate with it.

We should say identity is the organizing principle. Also, identity is at the core of all things. We no longer say any thing is purposeful merely by having described it. It is subjective to the one perceiving. However, purpose is always implied but depends on the observer.

<removed>
#### Purpose

Purpose stands in relation to observable, measurable effect. Thus, a purpose is justified by its fitness with regard to its purpose. Fitness is determined by measuring how well it causes real world effect in relation to the purpose.

(describes what the property purpose should be)
Usefulness is the root purpose, and a thing defines its specific purpose based in that core purpose. Thus, all things are purposeful. All things are useful to their varying purposes.

What does a _thing of things_ do? Organize the field of perception in acordance with choice based in usefulness. Things are choosen in such a way that they become useful to the defined purpose. The person is thus actively giving structure to perception in such a way that it responds to the purpose. The purpose itself is described under this property.

(a thing is therefor self-fulfilling)

Degrees of purposefulness: The purpose can be modified and the thing still fulfills it. In two things with identical purpose but slightly different structure and constitution, there should be an observable effect of how well the thing fulfills the purpose, by which the purposefulness is measured.

</removed>

#### Constitution

The perception of difference constitutes a thing. That is: a thing consists of the fundamental feature of differentiation.

Perception of difference allows for unique things to be percieved. Before any structure is seen in any thing, these are just things that are different from each other. Because we need useful things, we recognize uniqueness among things and ascribe different purpose to different things. We deem things purposeful, meaning the thing aligns in such a way it produces outcome deemed useful. _Constitution_ are the things that a thing must consist of for it to be able to align with its purpose.

There need to be different things, which are the very things being part of the thing, that

The color green is not yellow. We know there is a difference, but still, at this stage, there is no meaning ascribed to the things themselves. We have not yet linked them fully with a purpose, just recognized that there are different things, and that we have selected some things listed under _constitution_ that later (in _emergence_) will show to be meaningful to the purpose.

we can say, when we rely on external conceptual units like _tokens_, its constitution, but when internal, its property. so _data format_ and _data type_ is property, because its a characteristic we see within the structure made by the constituting things. properties are thus not things. but defines a thing. Any _thing_ that is part of a thing is constitution

#### Property

#### Emergence

(There can be many emergences...)

(The typical meaning of emergence)... The constitution and properties, and relations among them, form emergent patterns and behaviours.

### X properties

#### Self-evident

A thing is the description of itself. The description of a thing is not external to itself. A blueprint would be a thing (it is a blueprint) that describes another thing. However, both the blueprint and the building it describes are two separate things, sharing the very same _thingness_. Because all things have _thingness_, all objects are their own description. They are self-evident. They do not need anything to describe them because their very composition is the highest level description of what they are. The _thing of things_ itself, does not need these words. It exists in its completeness regardless. That means: all things can be seen to represent the structure described here.

#### Structured perception determines a things existence

A thing exists when it is percieved. If not percieved, we can not know it exists. An object in the other room does not exist, but the sense it does is based on an assumption, perhaps because we were in the room 1 minute earlier. A thing comes into existence and goes out of existence, as it comes and goes out of perception. We can not percieve that it does exist, while we do not percieve it. (There is only things as perceived).

<may need rework after purpose property is removed>
#### Self-creating/defining

A thing, as a particular thing, is perceived based on perception being structured to percieve it. Perception being structured differently, yields a different thing being percieved. The thing is as it is perceived. There is no "real thing" beside the perceived, and that the percieved would be inacurate. There is no perceive less, perceive more, but both modes of perception yields different things. An "inacurate" perception would be its own thing. Those are things, in that they come to be influential as exactly those things to person perceiving them. Based on perception, the thing is determined useful to a degree, and the person will make choice, attempting the better outcome as determined by the persons idea of what is desirable (the persons purpose). A pencil has a purpose, etc. If a person from pre-pencil era witness a pencil, he would maybe think of it as a stick, and then it exists as a stick to him. The structuring of perception determines what a thing is to the person.

(... self-contained, self-applying, and self-evolving.)

</may need rework after purpose property is removed>

#### Self-referential

It describes the system while simultaneously being the very system it describes.

#### Completeness

A _thing of things_ is the structuring of perception that represents the completeness of any object. A _thing of things_ stears to organize perception of a thing into a complete organization of all aspects the thing. That means: every possible aspect of the thing is structured in perception. A thing can be perceived without explicit awareness of all its aspects, (identity, constitution etc...), but because the object consist of all those aspects, it still describes itself as such, merely by occuring to perception. However, the quality of the thing, meaning the choice-influencing form it adopts in perception, depends on how the perception is structured. This ontology structures perception in th
best possible form, because it captures all aspects of the thing.

### Thing properties

- A thing is what it is not.
  - The color blue is not red, not tall, not loud, not magnetic. When we remove all things we know blue is not, then we see that what remains is the quality of blue. Thus, the color blue is blue.
- A thing is not non-existing, because a non-existing thing is different from the thing. Blue can not be blue, if blue does not exist.
- A thing is immutable, in that it can not change and still be the same thing.
- A thing is a particular thing, it is not another thing.
- A things existence is contingent on perception. If a thing is not perceived, it is not a thing. If a thing is perceived, it is a thing.
- A thing must have an identity.

## Emergence

### Self-emergence

Self-emergence is the unifying emergent principle by which a _thing of things_ achieves its self-hood, meaning it can itself enact whatever is required of it, like being self-organizing, self-constituting, self-defining etc. It is thus not relying on external instruction. Its recursive nature implies it never, at any point, was relying on external instruction. It is thus not a system described by something outside it. It is self-describing. It describes any thing, including itself, using itself.

At the core, we have the recognition of difference in perception. How perception is differentiated (meaning where we percieve the boundaries of a thing) is defined by its identity. One may be surprised many more expensive speakers do not come with cables or even amplifiers. That is because in the domain of high end speakers another ontology presides, where the concept of a speaker is limited to the actual speaker unit, whereas in the budget market, a speaker is understood as "that which makes sound" which then implies a whole set of common things such as sound cables and power adapters. A thing here, thus is understood and delineated by an describable idea. If you ask the dealer in a high end shop about the cables, he would _describe_ the _idea_ that the speaker unit is _just the speakers and not the sound cables_. In a _Thing of Things_, the identity is the highest delimiting factor, which is also contained within the thing, and thus the thing contains its own boundaries. (It is thus self-delimiting).

The _Thing of Things_ contains its own boundary as a reflection of its identity. Embeded in the thing itself, is the identity which is the highest structural contraint, or structural affirmation.

It is the act of differentiating perception to isolate _identity_ as a property in a thing (rather than putting the identity outside the thing), that makes the identity give rise to self-emergence, in the sense that any other thing within the thing must align it-_self_ with the identity, thus, the thing becomes self-enacting.

It contains the conditions for its own organization.

#### Self-aserting

(Perhaps the most impoprant emergent feature of a thing): All properties are aligned to support the identity. This is implicit, as the identity is integral, and a identity can not be integral to a thing that does not honor it. The boundary of a thing (how a thing is differentiated from other things) is based in the identity. Things that do not align with the identity, are simply outside the thing, not part of the thing. Remember, a thing is self-evident. It does not need a description on a paper, like a blueprint. It itself is its own description. It will be self-evident if a thing relates to the identity or not. If we describe the thing, we can do conceptual errors of putting non-identityful aspects in the description, but that is just a bad description, and will simply not have effect in reality.

The _thing of things_ is a framework used to structure the perception of a thing, and as such,
The property identity, of _thing of things_ defines the root-identity. The role of a identity is to "organizes the perception of its _thingness_ for exhaustive perceptual clarity (thus, including itself)." Here, the validity of _identity_ is measured against perceived resonance with its parts (or its parts with the property identity).

#### Self-defining

It names and identifies its own role and composition.

#### Self-constituting

#### Self-organizing

Or is it self-organizing? Self-organizing: Through structured perception and categorization.

#### Self-reflecting

It describes itself using the same descriptive categories that define other things.

It applies to itself what it applies to all other things.

#### Self-fulfilling

By defining its identity, it generates the means to fulfill it.

#### Sum

For any thing to be perceived, there needs to be perception of difference. Based in percieving difference, we recognize a thing, any thing, has properties, , identity, etc. Thus, several dimensions of a thing are outlined. This differentiation among aspects of a thing is possible, because the fundamental constitution of any object, is differentiation. By differentiating things of perception, a set of aspects, or dimensions, or properties, of a thing can be perceived.

<maybe remove this as we removed property purpose>
The relations between these properties (purpose, constitution, property etc) of the thing, gives rise to certain emergent features of the thing, which comes to further define the _thing of things_. Remember, the _thing_ is the specific thing, whereas _thing of things_ refer, also to the specific thing, but to its general structure, defined as _thing of things_. The _thing of things_ **is** a thing just as any thing. Any thing can be percieved as such, without any other specific qualities. However, to call specific things into perception, they must be differentiated for their unique attributes, and the _thing of things_ serves as a way to structure perception of any thing to frame the perception of its specific content with exhausting perceptual clarity, which is achieved by structuring perception to frame its specific content in all its dimensions (properties), not just a few. The degree of a specific hammer's usefullness is better understood if the totality of what makes the hammer is understood. Therein is for example the purpose of the hammer. Reviewing the constitution (its parts) also reveals its degree of usefulness, and so on. The property _purpose_, as seen as integral property of the thing, makes the object self-defining. Here, the property is _purpose_ "perceptually recognized" as integral to the thing.

</maybe remove this as we removed property purpose>

In the same way, the thing is recognized to be related to other distinct things, which are perceived by the same capability of perception of difference, is able to discern the things being part of the constitution of the thing. The constitution is also seen as integral to the thing. One could argue the parts of a speaker are not integral to it (they are different external things, just put in the same speaker box, and they all have their own blueprints and can even be sold separately). However, the boundary of a thing (how we differentiate it from other things) is determined here by the integral identity of a thing. All things needed for the identity are considered integral to the thing. The thing specifies all of its parts in _constitutoin_ and a thing is thus self-constituting.

~A _thing of things_ is self-organizing, in that the structure l~

whose content combined creates the absolute uniqueness of the thing.

We recognize the constitution and properties align with the identity of the thing, whatever the thing. The alignment of constitution and properties, with identity, gives the emergence of the thing being self-defining, because it defines its own identity. By its self-definition, it determines what constitution is needed, and thus is self-constituting.

Just as integral to the thing as identity is, is also the structure that fulfills the identity, and thus the thing is self-fulfilling.

## Reflections

(It's not concerned with for example a distant star you do not perceive, because if that would matter, then every posibility in eternity would matter. A distant star could matter to an astronomer, because he or she can perceive it and deems it useful to study).

# Previous attempts below

---

A thing defines its purpose and defines all constitution, properties and emergence needed to fulfill that purpose. A thing thus is both self-defining, self-constituting and self-fulfilling.

---

... structures and their relations, as seen in the differentiated perception, when the differentiated perception is organized around the things purpose. The identity is the explicit statement of the emergence as it's identity.
The identity is the statement based in purpose and emergence.

Constitution: the thing is constituted by differentiated perception.

Properties:
It's a concept not a representation.
A thing has these properties:
Identity - The identity of a thing is its emergence as aligned with the purpose.

Purpose - the purpose defines the things purpose. the purpose of a thing is to fulfill its self-defined purpose.

Constitution - the thing has parts that supports the emergence that in turn aligns with the purpose.

Properties: properties in alignment with emergence, in turn in alignment with purpose.

Emergence - The properties are defined to organize the differentiated perception. They are defined based in the purpose which is an organizing principle.

Emergence:

# Ontology of thing of things

Identity: The _Ontology of thing of things_ an ontology in that it describes a _thing of things_. A _thing of things_ is a root meta-structure: that is self-defining, self-constituting, self-organizing, and self-reflecting.

- It defines defines the general structure of any specific structure, including itself.
- It is constituting any structure, including itself.
- It organizes any structure, including itself.
- It describes any structure, including itself, using descriptive categories that are structures defined by _it_, and that are _it_ in essence.

A _thing of things_ is a discernable purposeful entity that contains discernable enteties that are purposeful to the thing.

Purpose:

What does a _thing of things_ do? Organize the field of perception in acordance with choice based in usefulness. (a thing can thus self-constituting, as the root purpose of all things, is to organize the field of perception (meaning define constitutions, properties etc) in accordance with choice based in usefulness. Usefulness is the root purpose, and a thing defines its specific purpose based in that core purpose)

- It is _root_ because it defines the general structure which is the structure of any specific structure.
- it is _meta_ because it is self-defining, self-constituting, self-organizing, and self-reflecting.

Self-defining: It names and identifies its own role and composition.

Self-constituting: Its purpose (root intent) determines what differences matter — thus, it creates the parts it needs to fulfill that intent.

Self-organizing: Through structured perception and categorization.

Self-reflecting: It describes itself using the same descriptive categories that define other things.

## A Thing of things

Identity: An identifiable entity that can be distinguished from other entities. (Thus, it is the same as for _thing_)... purposeful perception of difference

Purpose: The purpose is to serve a purpose.

Constitution:

- A _thing of things_ consists of _things_.
- The association of particular things as related to purpose.
- Purpose
- Emergence
- Constitution,
- Identity,

Property:

~- One thing can be associated with one or more other things.~

~Emergence: The knowing of difference among perceptions, leads to the knowing the percieved as a particular thing. A thing exists as it is known.~

Emergence: A particular thing can be known by percieving a difference with everything that it is not. Many particular things can be associated with eachother, organized around a particular purpose. The many particular things, organized around a purpose, are the constitution of an emergent _thing of thing_ that is a particular thing that consists of all the particular things and their relations.

For example: this very thing being described right now, is based in purpose, constitution, property, and these together comprise a unifying thing called _thing of things_.

## Thing

(A thing is defined here using a _thing of things_, and a _thing of things_ in turn is consisting of many _thing_. Thus we recognize a _thing_ itself as a _thing of things_. A _thing_ thus is not merely a simple smaller building block, but part of a recursive self-definition)

Identity: An identifiable entity that can be distinguished from other entities.

Purpose: The purpose of a thing is to be able to relate to a purpose.

Constitutes:

- The perception of difference constitutes a thing. That is: a thing consists of the fundamental feature of differentiation.
- Purpose constitutes a thing. A purpose is what is determined to be useful.

Property:

- A thing is what it is not.
  - The color blue is not red, not tall, not loud, not magnetic. When we remove all things we know blue is not, then we see that what remains is the quality of blue. Thus, the color blue is blue.
- A thing is not non-existing, because a non-existing thing is different from the thing. Blue can not be blue, if blue does not exist.
- A thing is immutable, in that it can not change and still be the same thing.
- A thing is a particular thing, it is not another thing.
- A things existence is contingent on perception. If a thing is not perceived, it is not a thing. If a thing is perceived, it is a thing.
- A thing must have a purpose.

Emergence:

a thing is a discernible purposeful entity relating to other discernible purposeful entities

A thing is constituted by the perception of difference, steered by purpose. That means: the perception of difference is structured in relation to purpose.

The emergence is a purposeful discernable entity that can relate to other enteties.

## Purpose:

Purpose: The _purpose_ of a thing is to define a purpose, which is an organizing principle that steers perception of difference.

Constitutes: _thing_

Purpose consists of values. One thing is favoured over another, because it is more useful.
Choice: one thing is chosen over another, because it is more useful to the purpose.

Property:
A value can not be its opposite value. Good can not be bad and bad can not be good.
A choice can not choose both things, because then it would not be a choice.
Choice is necessary, as things are presented to perception in a way that requires a choice to be made.
Self-preserving: Values are based in self-preserving, not self-destructive.
Self is not bound to ones body, but one can identify self in other things, such as relatives or an organization, and thus seek its slef-preservance.

Emergence:

## Identity

Purpose: Give structure to the perception of difference.

Identity: Identity is the definition of the thing, as has emerged from a things constitution and properties, in alignment with the purpsose of the thing.

Constitution: _thing_, purpose, perceptoin,

Property:

- An identity must be based in the emergence.
- It must be related to the purpose.
- It must belong to a _thing of things_.

Emergence: Relating to the purpose, the differentiation of perception is done to identify what is useful to the purpose, and the identity emerges as the concept of the very structure being percieved.

## Property

## Constituent

Constitution: _thing_, purpose, _thing of things_

Property:

Purpose: To be part of a set of things to cause emergence in accordance with the purpose.

Emergence: Being part of a _thing of things_, the _thing_ emerges as a part capable of relating to other parts in relation to the purpose of the _thing of things_.

## Emergence

Identity: The _emergence_ is the thing that is the result of the constitution and properties of the _thing_ in alignment with the purpose

Constitutes: thing, purpose, constutution, property.

Emergence: the things and properties gives an emergent structure.

From

## The percieved

Identity: The _percieved_ the knowing of a thing.

Constitution:

Property:

- Perception is constant. No moment of non-perception can be known, only assumed.

Emergence:

## Differentiation

- The _isness_ of a thing is dependent on the perception of a thing. There is no _isness_ beyond perception that we care about, because _isness_ beyond perception can not be percieved, and thus, there can be no "care about". It means, whatever is percieved, also has meaning, merely by virtue of being percieved. The degree of meaning depends on the goal. Perception of a thing is based in the active descernment of difference. Perception is the knowing of one thing by knowing it is different from all the things that are different from it. Perception is active in the sense that one state of perception of can be different from another, and a progression of different perecptions occur. Perception is active in the sense of occuring. Perception is an occuring process of differentiation.

## Start

### A thing is

There is perception of this sentence right now. In this sense, this sentence is real. When remembering the sentence, the sentence is no longer real as something that occured to perception, but the very memory of it is real. Just like the sentence was real when it was percieved, the very memory of it that now occurs, is real as it is percieved right now. There is a present moment, in the sense there is a current perception right now. Any memory of the past and thought of the future must be a thing that is real only as a memory or thought in the very moment of perception. The thing the memory or thought refer to, is not real, because that which it refers to, is not present to perception, but only the reference to it is, meaning the memory itself is real, but not what it refers to.

Memories and thoughts occur in a space of concepts. Concepts are real as they occur to perception. A concept is also unreal, in the sense it is not the very thing it refers to. The occurence of the concept in perception--the thinking of the thought-- is not the occurence of the thing the concept refers to--the thought is not the thing being thought of.

A concept is a reference to something that existed, exists or may exist in the sense of occuring to perception. A concept always refers to something real. The concept of "water flowing upstreams" refers to both "water" and "flowing" which in turn are concepts that relate to the occurence of these realities to perception at some point. The unrealistic concept "water flowing upstreams" is a concept refering to a future occurence of such a phenomenon.

Concepts can be realistic or unrealistic. Things that occur to perception appear in patterns and with continuity. These patterns and continium reflects a rule by which things in perception organize themselves. A concept can refer to a past, present, or future thing in a way that is not supported by rule of things. Thus, while the concept correctly does refer to something, that very thing will not occur to perception.

This is true at a fundamental level, because the color blue can not be the color red at the same time in perception, or it would break the ability to percieve a thing, as thins can not be distinquished. There may be an alternative universe in which the unrealistic is realistic, but the goal of this theory of ontology is to support ontology that focuses on effectivity as measured by how well the ontology organizes things and relations among things to support the ontology's stated purpose.

There is only preception of the current moment. That I existed yesterday is an assumption based on a memory and an assumption based on observatoins of that physichal bodies appear consistently over time, and that "I" am associated with a specific such body. There is a stage of waking up from deep sleep, where I sometimes do not recall my waking identity, I do not know where I am, I do not know what time it is. In the absence of memories, I do not know if, how and where I existed yesterday.

### Things are

There is the field of perception.

Things exist in the field of perception.

Cognition arises from change in the field of perception.

Cognition arises in relation the percieved.

## The newest here:

## More things...

Do not wrongfully make categories into things. A category holding 3 sub-cats should not lead to the assumption the three sub-cats create an emergent thing that would be the parent cat. Perhaps, as a rule, do not have overarching categories. Whats the purpose, other than wrongfully used convention for the sake of it, rather than as with structural relevance as reason.
The document should only consist of things, not categories that are not things.. Each heading represents a thing. What about sub,headings? Should then Conceptual definition and semantic attribution be _things_... as that is my way of categorizing... yes, they can be made into ontological things, ... I guess..

--
Recognize the conceptual casual chain...
For identity, describe by order of conceptual casual chain...

## A thing, format

Identity: A thing's identity is what the thing is not. Identity is a constitution of the rest or is there any reason for this category.

Each concept is a thing created by defining what it is, but without reference to a more abstract or concrete layer. An example of a reference to a more abstract layer is if _a[1,2]_ + _b[1,2]_ = _c[11,12,21,22]_, then we have 4 different _c_, and it would be tempting to group them under a general category _x_, which would then look like a general thing that can be any of the four, but there is no _general thing_, there are just these four _c_. Example: A _field_ has _data format_ and _data type_ and combined they create a set of _data constructs_. We could wrongfully assume those _data constructs_ are _fields_, but there _is_ no thing called _field_, only our own grouping of the four _data constructs_ which are _things_.

It also does not refer to representational layer; that which is semantically attributed to. That would be to refer to the more concrete level.

Identity starts with "X is..."

The _thing_ IS, by all its parts and properties, the culminating emergence. Without the category "identity", there is just emergence as structure, but no definitive clarification that that is what the thing _is_. "Identity" clearly states what of its constitution makes its total identity. Identity thus is the totality of the structure constituting the thing.

Properties:

If it is a description of structure within, it is a property.

Constitution:

If it is a thing, it can be a constitution of another thing.

we can say, when we rely on external conceptual units like _tokens_, its constitution, but when internal, its property. so _data format_ and _data type_ is property, because its a characteristic we see within the structure made by the constituting things. properties are thus not things. but defines a thing. Any _thing_ that is part of a thing is constitution

A property is not a thing, but something seen in the structure of a thing. A constituting element is itself a thing, and thus is part of the structure of the composed thing."

Emergence:
We treat emergence not as an extra feature of a thing, but as the thing itself.

## Constitution

Constituents:

## Property

Property 1:
Name: Example: data format.
Inference: Inferred/explicit property.
Recognition:
Modes: Example: X can be either true or false
Interface labels:
Props automatically give labels, for example:
[data construct: data format (inline | block)]

Property 2:
Name: Example: data type.
...
[data construct: data type (identifier | literal)]

## Emergence

Name:
Type Structural, behavioral, or functional emergence
Recognition:

### Property

Identity: A property is a _thing_ that is a concept, existing in the space if thought, describing the characteristic of a _thing_.
Constitution: Space of thought, a _pre-fundamental thing_ which encapsulates things.
Property:
Emergence: Characteristic.

### The ontological chain:

Emergence depends on property, and property depends on constitution.
Constitution alone does not produce emergence — it must be interpreted to yield properties.
Properties are recognized internal structures among the constitutional things, and these recognized structures are the emergent thing that the thing _is_.

Constitution ➝ Property ➝ Emergence

Layer What it is Relation to the others
Constitution The composed-of layer — the structural components that are themselves things. Provides the basis for...
Property The patterned or characteristic layer — structural features seen in the assembled parts. Emerges from constitution, but is not reducible to it.
Emergence The new thing that comes into being from the configuration of properties. Arises only when the properties align in a way that creates new structural identity.

## Defining the building block of the ontology

A _thing of thins_ is:
Self-defining: It names and identifies its own role and composition.

Self-constituting: Its purpose (root intent) determines what differences matter — thus, it creates the parts it needs to fulfill that intent.

Self-organizing: Through structured perception and categorization.

Self-reflecting: It describes itself using the same descriptive categories that define other things.

### Defining the _thing_ of a thing.

Identity:
Constitution:

- Constituted by the perception of difference.
- Purpose, that one discerned thing is favored (choosen) over another.
- Value of good and bad basis of choice and purpose. An usefull thing is good, a harmful thing is bad.

A _thing of things_ is also constituted by the structure of purpose, identity, constitution, property, and emergence. Thus, a _thing of a thing_ is self-constituting (consisting of the things it defines), self-organizing (organizes itself by the way it defines), and self-reflecting (describes itself using the categories it created). (In addition to this, it is self-defining, in that it identifies its own role in the purpose part, and the purpose part is a result of its self-constituting ability to create such a thing called "purpose")
i

... any constitution of a thing, is the perception of difference, steered by purpose, thus steered perception creates the things needed to fulfil the purpose of the thing.

... The thing envelops many parts and self-constitutes it by enveloping them.”

Property: A thing has the property of containing units. An unit is percieved because of the difference between it and other units. Things are percieved on basis of purpose and usefulness.

Emergence: One unit, delinated in the field of perception, emerges, which has many units. The unit is purposeful.

(The thing of things: It is constituted by perception of difference and the value-driven favoring of one thing over another. It has properties, such as the ability to contain subunits and be perceived as a unit. It gives emergence to structures — these emergent things are the solid, nameable "units" of your system (like data construct). That emergent unit becomes the first usable "Thing" in your ontology.)

A thing of things is a discernible purposeful entity containing other, to the thing of things, discernible purposeful entities.

### Defining the description of a thing:

Identity: The description of a thing is the description, as outlined in text, of the thing's. The descriptoin follows a structure of identity, constitution, property, and emergence.
Constitution: Identity, constitution, property, and emergence.
Property:

- Sequence: The order of the categories is as follows: identity, constitution, property, and emergence.

Emergence: Combining the constitutions of identity, constitution, and property, the emergence in sequence, is the description of the thing.

### Defining identity, constitution, property, and emergence

(Each their own heading, each their own thing)

#### Identity

Identity: Is a concept...
Constitution: Consists of a _thing of things_.

Property:

- Self reliant (: Each concept is a thing created by defining what it is, but without reference to a more abstract or concrete layer.) And all the rest...
  Emergence:

Emergence: a _thing of things_ takes the form of _identity_ by the combined properties...

### Ontological Truth of a System

#### Goal

The purpose of this ontology is to define the fundamental nature of an effective system by identifying its ontological truth—what it is at the most basic level. The ontology establishes that things are the fundamental concept, as all systems are composed of things and their relationships, and that, while systems may be percieved without having been intended by a particular conscious agent, an effective system, more precicely, _is_ caused by a conscious agent. The effectiveness of the system is dependent on the ontological truth established by the agent.

#### Concepts

Things:
(Things that exist independently and can be uniquely identified.)

> [!Note]
> This ontology uses itself to describe itself, thus, in the category of things, we have the concept of "things" itself.

- Things: The most fundamental objects in this ontology—anything that can be identified, distinguished, or considered as existing.
  - Exist if they can be distinguished from what they are not.
  - A thing has unique properties or an unique combination of properties making the thing distinguishable and separate from another thing.

> [!Note]
> Now, "things" is a thing in this ontology. Here, it is a thing, that describes what things are.

- Agents: Conscious observers that recognize things and impose structure by creating systems.
  - Can observe, distinguish and identify things.
  - Can intend to impose structure on things by establishing an ontological truth.
  - Can organizing things and their relationships in accordance with the ontological truth.

Emergent structures:

- Relationship:
  - A thing can relate to one or more things and can be related to by one or more things. (A door in a wall relates to the wall and the floor, the inside and outside).
- Structure:
  - A structure is an identifiable totality, a set, consisting of things and their relationships. A set of football players can be arranged in a particular strategic formation, distinct from another formation.
  - A structure has properties of its own. For example: the formation of the football players has a property of being a defensive formation.
  - A structure may or may not exist regardless an agent's awareness of it. The things and the relationships among them that gives rise to a structure, must be specified, for the structure to be recognized as a structure. The agent specifies them in the ontological truth of the system.
  - A structure is an emergent entity that depends on the things and their relationships, but is in itself independent of any agent’s intent and goal. A structure may exist as intended and recognized by one agent, but may also exist in another place, not intended by the same agent, or not intended at all by any agent.
- System:

  - A system emerges when an agent organizes things into a structure. A system is different from a structure, in that it is a structure that alignings with the agent’s intent as stated by the ontological truth.

- Ontological truth:

  - The agent, by observing and identifying things, and by intending to impose a system, specifies an ontological truth of a goal, what the things relevant to the goal are (the ensures the existence of the relevant things and describes them), the relationships between them, their emergent enteties.

  (enteties that do not exist independently, but as a result of things and their relationships, [...] and

- Effectiveness:
  - How well a system's entities, properties, and relationships produce an observable, measurable effect that aligns with the agent’s intent.
  - Effectiveness itself is objective (it can be observed and measured), but it cannot be asserted without defining the system’s goal.

#### Relationships

Dependencies:

- Things exist independently.
- Systems depend on things; no system can exist without things.
- The ontological truth of a system depends on the intent of the agent creating it.

Rules:

- A system's ontological truth is determined by the most fundamental description of its things and their relationships.
- If a system aligns with its intended purpose, it can be measured and refined.
- The effectiveness of a system is determined by how well it adheres to its ontological truth.
- External interference or unintended changes can alter the system, but they do not change its ontological truth—only its effectiveness.

#### Context

Constraints:

- Things must be distinguishable to be considered as existing.
- A system must be intentionally created by an agent to have an ontological truth.
- If no agent observes or defines a system, it cannot be formally described, but things still exist independently.

Assumptions:

- The existence of things is a priori; it does not require justification beyond distinction.
- Conscious agents are necessary to recognize and define systems.
- The effectiveness of a system can be evaluated through observation and measurement.

External Factors:

- The environment in which things exist may affect their relationships and interactions.
- External changes to a system may impact its function but do not alter its fundamental ontological truth.

#### Representation

Storage:

- The ontology can be represented as structured text, logic statements, or a formal graph of entities and relationships.
- It can be modeled mathematically, expressed as first principles in logic, or described philosophically.
- It can also be used to define other ontologies, forming the foundation for classifying systems.

#### Meta-Classification

Self-Reference:

- This ontology is categorized under meta-ontologies, as it serves as a foundational framework for defining any system.
- It classifies itself as the ontology of ontologies, providing first principles from which any system can be described.
- This ontology can define itself using its own principles by treating itself as a system composed of things, such as concepts, rules, relationships, and constraints.

## Ontological Truth of a System

### First Principle: Things as the Fundamental Concept

Every system must have an ontological truth, which is the fundamental description of what the system is. However, before we can define a system, we must define things, because it is among things that we can discern whether a system exists.

### Defining "Things"

A thing is anything that can be identified, distinguished, or considered as existing. Things are the most fundamental concept, because without them, no relationships, properties, or systems can be perceived.

- A thing exists if it can be distinguished from what it is not.
- A thing is fundamental because it is a necessary precursor to any structure or organization.
- A thing does not require a system to exist, but a system requires things to exist.

### From Things to Systems

1. Things exist.
2. If multiple things exist, they may interact or relate.
3. When interactions or relationships between things are observed, we can define a system.
4. The ontological truth of a system is the fundamental description of these things and their relations.

### The Role of Conscious Agents

A conscious agent observes things and can form an intent to create a system. This intent gives rise to the system's ontological truth—the most fundamental description of the system based on what the agent perceives and aims to structure.

1. The agent observes things.
2. The agent intends to organize things into a system.
3. The agent creates a system by establishing relationships, properties, and constraints among things.
4. The ontological truth of the system is the formal description of the created structure.

### The System and Its Effectiveness

Once created, the system functions according to its ontological truth. The effectiveness of the system is determined by how well it complies with the agent's intent.

- If a system aligns with its intended purpose, its effect is distinguishable from unintended modifications or external interference.
- The system's effects can be perceived and measured, allowing the agent to evaluate and refine its structure.
- The distinction between the system's designed effect and the consequences of modifying the system allows for an ongoing refinement of its ontological truth.

Thus, a system is the result of a conscious agent's intent to organize things, and its ontological truth serves as the foundational description that determines its effectiveness.

## Also old stuff:

Difference exist. The color blue and red are different.

Nothingness does not exist, because nothingness implies the non-existence of a thing. So nothingness would have to be a thing for it to not exist. And a thing implies existence.
Thingness does not exist as a contrast to nothingness. Thingness exist in contrast to other thingness.
Thingness in contrast to nothingness would mean nothingness is a thing that thingness is in contrast to, like blue is to red, but nothing is nota thing in any way.

Exist if they can be distinguished from what they are not.

Things:
Concept.
Emergence.

A concept is a percieveable set of one or more distinct qualities. E.g. a football player.

A concept can relate to another concept. E.g. One football player on the same field as another football player.
A relation is a concept. It has distinct quality. The quality of a relation is that two or more thins are percieved at the same time. The distinct quality of the relation is for example: the football players are a pair.
A relation is an emergent quality of concepts.
The emergent relation can be a thing, that is is defined as team, that means the parts in the relation share a common goal.

---

Each concept is a thing created by defining what it is, but without reference to a more abstract or concrete layer.”

Emergence is based in property, which is based in constitution.

The thing of things is a ladder that can climb itself.

Identity: The _thing of things_ is a

Constitution: the _ontology of thing of things_ consists of a _thing of things_.

- Perception of difference.

- Value-driven favoring of one thing over another.
- Purposeful, ...
- The _thing of things_ consists of _thing of things_. It is thus self-constituting.
- Ontology

Property: The _thing of things_ is self-constituting, because it constitutes itself.

Emergence:

The ontology of _thing of things_ is a root meta-ontology.

## Is

Identity: _Is_ is a reference to a particular state of perception. "There is a house there" refers to the perception of the structure of a house. The structure is known, and anything that is known, has _isness_.

Constitution: The percieved.

Property:

- _Is_ is.
- _Is_ can not be not. A house that is perceived can not be not perceived. Take note: _is_ is a thing, in the sense of being present in any state of perception. Whatever is percieved, _is_ percieved. We can know there is an _is_ where there is perception, because if there is no perception, there is no _is_ there. But is _is_ known by negating it with _not_. No, because we can not percieve _not_ because it would be the absense of perception, thus non-perceptible. Thus we can not know _is_ by negating it with something we don't know. We need to know something else that is contrasting, in order to know that there is _is_, but if we can only percieve _is_ and not percieve its contrast, which is absense, then we can not know that _is_ exists. _Is_ is not real. It is perhaps an assumption. It assumes a trancendental _is_ that is common to all things percieved.

How then is _is_ defined? It is defined as "the percieved".

- _Is_ is not a thing such as an abstract force or entity in addition to whatever is percieved. _Is_ is the _isness_ by virtue of the percieved. The percieved can not be percieved if it is
- The absense of _is_ can not be known and would remain an assumption.
- _Is_ is self-evident. It needs nothing but itself to be known.
- Only _is_ is known.
